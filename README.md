# Game of Life

This project is a Python implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway. The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your machine. Also, you need to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pygame numpy
```

### Installing

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Baelrin/game-of-life.git
```

Then navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd game-of-life
```

And run the main script:

```bash
python master.py
```

## Usage

After running the script, you will see a window displaying the game grid. You can interact with the game in the following ways:

- Click on a cell to toggle its state between alive and dead.
- Press the space bar to pause and resume the game.
